    Verify that the Users API correctly handles concurrent user creation requests.

    Purpose:
    - Ensure the backend can process multiple CREATE requests in parallel
      without race conditions, partial failures, or corrupted responses.

    What this test validates:
    - Parallel execution of multiple `create_user` calls using asyncio
    - Each request completes successfully
    - Each created user has a unique ID
    - All created users are registered for cleanup
    - Each user response passes contract validation

    Design notes:
    - Uses async API client backed by httpx.AsyncClient
    - Reuses existing factory, logging, and cleanup mechanisms
    - Keeps validation lightweight to avoid flakiness
