    Optional workflow test: simulate dependent operations that could trigger edge cases.

    Purpose:
    - Verify system handles dependent operations correctly (e.g., create → patch → delete → fetch).
    - Check correct error handling for operations on deleted or non-existent users.

    Validation:
    - Create user and immediately patch.
    - Delete user and confirm fetching raises 404.
    - Contract validation on successful responses.

    Design notes:
    - Mimics real multi-step workflows that might be used in production.
    - Reuses async API client and factory for consistency.
